# Advanced Compilers

## The m Ã— n Compiler Problem: Managing Multiplicative Complexity in Compiler Development
Each programming language requires a front-end to analyze and transform its syntax and semantics into an intermediate representation (IR). Each target architecture requires a back-end to generate optimized machine code. A direct approach would imply building separate compilers for each language-target pair. The science of compilers hasn't reached to that point yet
where developing compilers suitable for so many languages and targets is easy. Modern compiler design mitigates this challenge by employing intermediate representations, modular compiler infrastructures, and retargetable code generation.
